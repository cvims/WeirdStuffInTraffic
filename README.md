# Weird-Stuff-In-Traffic

### 🚦 Project Summary

Weird Stuff In Traffic is a gamified, web-based app that helps improve object detection models for autonomous driving. Users are prompted to generate bizarre or unexpected traffic scenes using natural language. A fine-tuned AI model then attempts to identify anomalies in these generated images.

The twist? You're trying to break the model — the more unusual the scene, the more likely you'll find its blind spots. This helps surface edge cases where the AI might fail, making it a valuable tool for stress-testing perception systems in self-driving cars.
